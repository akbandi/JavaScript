#### Note: Most of the code in app.js is taken from Dom's tutorial session on HW14. 

## Instructions

Use the D3 library to read in samples.json from the URL https://2u-data-curriculum-team.s3.amazonaws.com/dataviz-classroom/v1.1/14-Interactive-Web-Visualizations/02-Homework/samples.json.


### Create a horizontal bar chart with a dropdown menu to display the top 10 OTUs found in that individual.

1) Use sample_values as the values for the bar chart.

2) Use otu_ids as the labels for the bar chart.

3) Use otu_labels as the hovertext for the chart.


### Create a bubble chart that displays each sample.

1) Use otu_ids for the x values.

2) Use sample_values for the y values.

3) Use sample_values for the marker size.

4) Use otu_ids for the marker colors.

5) Use otu_labels for the text values.

6) Display the sample metadata, i.e., an individual's demographic information.

7) Display each key-value pair from the metadata JSON object somewhere on the page.

8) Update all the plots when a new sample is selected. Additionally, you are welcome to create any layout that you would like for your dashboard.
